\section{Introduction}
This document provides a report of Team JSK's progress in preparing for the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC). The team consists of members from the JSK Laboratory at the University of Tokyo. The JSK Lab, founded in early 1980â€™s, has a long history of robotics research with focus on areas including humanoids, drones, robotics manipulation, and perception, and the lab has experience in participating in robotics challenges including the DARPA Robotic Challenge and the Amazon Picking Challenge.

\subsection{Project Personnel}
Team JSK is made of eleven members: Prof. Masayuki Inaba, Prof. Kei Okada, Dr. Yohei Kakiuchi, Dr. Wesley Chan, Bakui Chou, Xiangyu Chen, Krishneel Chaudhary, Kohei Kimura, Yuki Furuta, and Hiroto Mizohana. The team is roughly divided into three groups corresponding to each task with groups having overlapping personnel.


%That is a professor, a associate-professor, a lecturer, a researcher, 4 Phd students and 2 Master students. 
%Teachers mainly focus on manage the whole team schedule, design hardware and software architecture, provide advices and give ideas for all the tasks. The rest researcher and students are divided into three groups, 
%one for computer vision development for all the tasks, one for task 2 and one for task 1 and 3.

\section{Future Plan}
For now our team finished both design and make the hardware for all the tasks. Build the software architecture and implement the detection and motion algorithm for all the tasks in simulation and tele-operation. However, since the the hardware are new designed and 
we need more time to debug and adjust the stability of the hardware performance. 

In the next step we will implement our detection and motion algorithm on our robot platform and try to make it full autonomous. For software algorithm design, we are trying to address the problem we faced in the simulation and come up with some novel ideas to solve that in real hardware platforms.
